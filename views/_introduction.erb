	<h3>What is version control?!</h3>

	<p>From <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control">Github:</a></p>
	<blockquote>
		Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. Even though the examples in this book show software source code as the files under version control, in reality any type of file on a computer can be placed under version control.
